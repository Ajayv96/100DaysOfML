# 100DaysOfML
This is my repository for the 100 days of ML challenge. I will spend one hour each day learning something related to ML and document my progress.

# Week 1: Brush up on python
# Week 2: Start learning pandas and numpy
# Week 3: Find a problem to solve and go through papers/blogs and videos on the same. Try to find/generate the dataset for the same.
# Week 4: From week 4, I will start implementing DL/ML to solve the problem I've chosen. 

# Will add day by day updates as well as weekly updates once I start the challenge.
